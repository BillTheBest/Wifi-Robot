Microcontroller Firmware
========================

Two different firmware options are provided, but they both do the same job.

The Arduino pde file can be compiled and run on any standard Arduino.  

Alternatively, the PIC code was written in assembly and the compiled hex file can be
flashed onto a PIC16F628A microcontroller.  This option is cheaper, but more complicated.

I would suggest using the Arduino code as it is easier to understand and to debug if
you run into any issues.
